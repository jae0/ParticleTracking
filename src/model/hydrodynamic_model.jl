    build_hydrodynamic_model(grid; kwargs...) -> HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel

Build a hydrostatic ocean model through `NumericalEarth.ocean_simulation`, returning the
bare `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` so that existing call sites (`set!`, `model.velocities`,
`model.tracers`, `model.closure`, `model.grid`) continue to work unchanged.

`ocean_simulation` returns an Oceananigans `Simulation`; this wrapper returns `sim.model`,
because this package supplies its own adaptive stepping, checkpointing and JLD2 output
machinery and therefore only needs the model object.

# Physics defaults chosen here, and why they differ from the library defaults
- `equation_of_state = TEOS10EquationOfState(reference_density = 1025)`. The library default
  is `reference_density = 1020`; this package works in the Boussinesq sense with ρ₀ = 1025.
  TEOS-10 is a full equation of state rather than the linearised form used previously, so
  buoyancy and N² differ from the old `LinearEquationOfState` results — this is an accuracy
  improvement, not a like-for-like swap.
- `coriolis` is left at the library default, `HydrostaticSphericalCoriolis`. The previous
  manual builder used `FPlane(latitude = 44.5)`, which freezes f and omits the β term; over a
  42–47.5 °N domain the β term is not negligible, so the spherical form is more appropriate.
- `closure` defaults to `VerticalScalarDiffusivity` with the caller's `ν`/`κ`, matching the
  previous behaviour. Pass `closure = :catke` for the library's prognostic NEMO-TKE closure.
- `free_surface = SplitExplicitFreeSurface(grid; cfl)`. The previous builder used
  `ImplicitFreeSurface`; the split-explicit barotropic solver is cheaper and is what the
  library considers the standard choice.
- `bottom_drag_coefficient` is left at the library default (`0.003`) because `Default` is not
  part of Oceananigans' public API in this build; `cd_drag` is therefore only honoured by the
  manual builder. Set it explicitly via the library kwarg if a different value is needed.

Surface heat/wind fluxes, tidal body forcing and the lateral sponge are *not* configured
here: `ocean_simulation` exposes them through different hooks (surface boundary conditions
and interior `forcing`) than this package's existing `Forcing`/BC construction, and they are
supplied by the caller through `forcing`/`boundary_conditions` below.

    #
    #   1. It does not constrain momentum. The u/v sponge still relaxes toward the analytic
    #      `u_inflow`/`v_inflow` constants, because WOA23 carries no currents. So the sponge
    #      fixes what the incoming water *is* (temperature, salt) and not how fast it is
    #      *going*. For a domain whose open edges are the main water source, that is half an
    #      open boundary, not a whole one, and a result that depends on inflow is still
    #      resting on two hand-entered numbers.
    #   2. It is time-independent. A climatology is one repeating state, so the boundary has
    #      no tidal, synoptic or seasonal cycle of its own. Eddies and storms arriving from
    #      outside are not represented.
    #   3. It covers T and S only. A model carrying oxygen (`enable_o2`) relaxes the other
    #      tracers not at all.
    #   4. It is CPU-only, because the targets are interpolation objects and therefore not
    #      `isbits`; the GPU path refuses rather than silently dropping the sponge.
    #
    # Closing any of these needs a source that supplies the missing quantity -- a reanalysis

    apply_reanalysis_initial_conditions!(model; dataset, date, variables) -> model

Initialise prognostic tracers from a reanalysis dataset using `ClimaOcean.Metadatum`.

`Metadatum` is the supported mechanism for injecting observed/reanalysis state into an
Oceananigans model: it carries both the value and its provenance (dataset, date, variable
name) so that archived output remains traceable to the source it came from. This replaces
the previous hand-rolled `interpolate_ocean_state`, which fabricated constant fields when the
dataset could not be read.

# Inputs
- `model`: Model whose tracers are to be initialised.
- `dataset`: A NumericalEarth dataset, e.g. `GLORYSDaily()`, `GLORYSMonthly()`, `WOAMonthly()`.
- `date`: `DateTime` for the initial state.
- `variables`: Tracer symbols to initialise, e.g. `(:T, :S)`.

# Outputs
- The model, with tracers set.

# Notes
If the dataset cannot be fetched (no credentials, no network), the failure is reported
loudly rather than silently substituting constant values, so a run never quietly claims a
reanalysis-forced state it did not have.

        -> (T = (x, y, z) -> …, S = (x, y, z) -> …, O_2 = (x, y, z) -> …)

Read a downloaded WOA23 (or WOA-series) climatology from NetCDF and return **callable
interpolants** of conservative temperature `T` (°C), practical salinity `S` (PSU) and,
optionally, dissolved oxygen `O_2` (µmol kg⁻¹) on the model grid.

The returned callables take grid coordinates `(x, y, z)` in degrees East, degrees North
and metres (negative down) and can be handed straight to `set!(model, T = …, S = …)`, which
is how Oceananigans accepts a spatially varying initial condition.

# Why this exists
`NumericalEarth` can construct `WOAMonthly`/`WOAAnnual` dataset objects, but its
`Column(grid, dataset; …)` constructor does **not** read a dataset — `Column` describes a
point/column *location*. The supported injection path is `ClimaOcean.Metadatum`, which needs
`Downloads.download` to accept a `Metadatum` and so does not give a keyless end-to-end route
from a plain NOAA NCEI file. Since WOA23 is served from an open THREDDS/ERDDAP endpoint that
needs no credentials, reading the file directly and regridding it here keeps the keyless path
real rather than aspirational.

# Interpolation
Horizontal regridding is bilinear in `(lon, lat)` via `Interpolations.jl`; the vertical uses
the dataset's own standard depth levels with linear interpolation in depth, clamped to the
shallowest available level above and the deepest below. Clamping matters: WOA23's deepest
levels are far deeper than the model domain, so an unclamped query would extrapolate.

Values that WOA23 masks to its fill value (WOA uses `-1.0e30`) are replaced by `NaN` before
interpolation and then filled with the horizontally interpolated mean of the valid column, so
land or ice-covered cells do not poison neighbouring water cells with a huge negative bias.

# Inputs
- `grid`: Model grid (an `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` is unwrapped to its underlying grid).
- `temperature_file`, `salinity_file`: Paths to NetCDF files with `t_an` / `s_an`.
- `oxygen_file`: Optional path to a NetCDF file with `o_an`.

# Outputs
- NamedTuple of callables, omitting `O_2` when `oxygen_file` is `nothing` or the model has no
  `O_2` tracer.

Two convention differences from the model grid are handled here:

  depths are negated and re-sorted to ascending (i.e. surface first).
* Longitudes are wrapped into `[-180, 180)` and re-sorted alongside the data. This is a no-op for

Holding rather than averaging matters because on a shelf domain most of the grid is masked.
Averaging turned a column valid only in its top ~20 levels into one flat value all the way to
5500 m, and a fully-masked column into literal `0.0` -- that is 0 K and 0 PSU, which in a
TEOS-10 density is a large spurious freshening rather than a neutral filler.

    _check_boundary_field_is_real(path, vals, what)

Refuse a boundary field that is structurally incapable of being an ocean.

This exists because a boundary file once came out of the download path with 5 depth levels
and no horizontal variation whatsoever: T = 14.0 and S = 31.5 at every point of an 18 x 8.5
degree box. It parsed cleanly, interpolated cleanly, and would have relaxed the sponge band
toward a constant while every downstream number looked entirely reasonable. Nothing about the
*use* of that file reveals the problem, so it has to be caught at the point of loading.

Two independent checks, because either failure alone is enough to make the field useless and
they fail for different reasons:

* **Depth coverage.** A real WOA23 column has 102 standard levels to 5500 m. A handful of
  levels means the column was truncated, and since the sampler clamps, the model would then
  treat the deepest level's value as applying all the way to the seabed.
* **Horizontal variation.** Real temperature and salinity at a fixed depth differ from place
  to place. A field that is constant across the domain is a stub or a default, and a sponge
  built from it is not constraining anything.

The thresholds are deliberately loose. They are here to catch a broken file, not to
second-guess a legitimately uniform region.

`degrees_celsius` or `degrees_C`, so this conversion is load-bearing in every case and is
not a special case for one provider.

    build_boundary_tracer_interpolators(T_path, S_path; T_name, S_name)

Build `(; T, S)` boundary targets from observed hydrography, for the lateral sponge.

Both file paths are explicit and both are required, because the sources disagree about how
they are packaged: WOA23 publishes temperature and salinity in separate files, GLORYS packs
both into one, and HYCOM puts them in one file under different names. Accepting a single
optional path and guessing the other is how this ended up with two different readers and a
truncated file nobody noticed. A caller now has to say where each field lives, and the grids
are checked to match before anything is returned.

Returns two callables, each `f(lon, lat, depth)` with **positive-down** depth. The WOA reader
negates its source axis, so this comes out positive-down; `build_hydrodynamic_model` negates
`z` before calling, so the sponge sees the model's negative-down coordinate.

This is what gives a keyless open edge real water in it. WOA23 is a monthly climatology
averaged over many years, so it describes an average boundary rather than a particular day;
it is a large improvement on unconstrained edges and a modest one on a dated reanalysis.

**It is an incomplete open boundary, not a complete one.** It constrains temperature and
salinity only. WOA23 carries no currents, so the inflow *velocity* still comes from the
configured `u_inflow`/`v_inflow` constants; and because a climatology is one repeating state,
the boundary has no tidal or synoptic cycle of its own. Any result that depends on how much
water crosses an open edge is still resting on those constants. A source with currents
(GLORYS) is what actually closes that, and it needs an account.

Set physically plausible initial `T` and `S` profiles on `model`.

Temperature is built from up to four overlapping components — a surface value, a
bottom value, a cold-intermediate-layer (CIL) minimum, and a continental-slope
minimum — with `temperature_gradient` setting the thermocline sharpness. Salinity is
constant unless a function is supplied.

All components are optional: with none given, a linear profile from
`surface_temperature` (default 14 °C) to `bottom_temperature` (default 4 °C) at
`temperature_gradient` is used, giving a stably stratified column.

# Notes
- The `temperature_*`/`temp_*` and `*_temp` spellings are accepted as aliases.
- Domain bounds, when supplied, are used to taper the shelf-slope component so it
  weakens outside the configured `lon_range`/`lat_range`.
- Values are broadcast across the horizontal grid, so the resulting field is
  horizontally uniform apart from the slope taper.
