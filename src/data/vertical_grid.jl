    two_segment_z_faces(; z_break, z_min, nz_above, nz_below, scaling_above, scaling_below)

Build a two-segment vertically stretched grid resolving a shallow, biologically active layer in
detail while still reaching a much deeper domain floor.

The single-segment tanh used previously cannot do both jobs. Over 0 to -5000 m it puts its
*coarsest* cell at the surface, which left the shallowest cell centre at -258 m: with `nz = 20`
there were **no cell centres above -200 m and none in the 0-50 m nursery band**, so the cold
intermediate layer, the thermocline, and the settlement depth were all unresolved. Shallowing
`z_min` instead would clip the 22 % of the domain that lies below 400 m (the Laurentian Fan
reaches ~4850 m) and put a false wall at the shelf break.

This grid instead splits the column at `z_break`:
- **above** `z_break` (e.g. 0 to -400 m): `nz_above` tanh-stretched levels, surface-refined, so the
  near-surface and nursery layer is resolved at metre scale;
- **below** `z_break` (e.g. -400 to -5000 m): `nz_below` levels, so the deep basin is retained
  without spending levels where nothing is resolved.

# Inputs
- `z_break::Real`: Depth of the segment boundary, negative (e.g. `-400.0`).
- `z_min::Real`: Domain floor, negative (e.g. `-5000.0`).
- `nz_above::Int`: Number of levels between 0 and `z_break`.
- `nz_below::Int`: Number of levels between `z_min` and `z_break`.
- `scaling_above::Real`: tanh stretching strength for the upper segment (larger = more
  surface refinement). Default `2.0`.
- `scaling_below::Real`: tanh stretching strength for the lower segment. Default `0.0`, i.e.
  near-uniform, which is appropriate for the deep basin where vertical structure is weak.

# Outputs
- `Vector{Float64}`: `nz_above + nz_below + 1` face depths, strictly ascending from `z_min` to 0.

Single-segment surface-refined grid: `nz` layers from `-Lz` to 0, finest at the surface.

This is a module-level, working replacement for the identically named helper that used to be
defined inside [`src/model/numerical_earth.jl`](@ref) and was therefore **not visible at module
scope** — the driver called it (`ParticleTrackingRun.jl`) and raised
`UndefVarError: stretched_tanh_z_faces not defined`, so a fresh hydrodynamics run could not build a
grid at all. The 2-year archive in `work/` predates that breakage.

Note that a single segment cannot resolve a shallow active layer while also reaching 5000 m: over
0 to -5000 m the top cell is still hundreds of metres thick. Prefer
[`two_segment_z_faces`](@ref) / [`scotian_shelf_z_faces`](@ref) for shelf work.

Convenience wrapper around [`two_segment_z_faces`](@ref) tuned for the Scotian Shelf, where the
biologically active layer is roughly 10-400 m and the Laurentian Fan extends to ~4850 m.

Defaults give 40 levels: 24 in the upper 400 m (surface-refined, ~2 m at the surface) and 16 below
(the deep basin, near-uniform ~290 m). This puts ~10 levels in the 0-50 m nursery band and ~24 in
the 0-400 m active layer, versus **0** in that band under the previous 20-level single-tanh grid.
